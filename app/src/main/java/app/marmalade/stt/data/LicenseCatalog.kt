/**
 * Static catalog of the third-party open-source components Marmalade STT
 * ships in the APK or downloads on demand (speech models), surfaced by the
 * in-app "Open-source licenses" screen
 * ([app.marmalade.stt.ui.screen.LicensesScreen]).
 *
 * This mirrors the per-component summary in the repo-root `NOTICE.md`. That
 * is the human-readable repo document; this is the app-facing data behind
 * Settings → About → Open-source licenses. **Keep them in sync** —
 * `LicenseCatalogTest` fails when a component here is missing from NOTICE.md.
 * Every component added to the APK (native libraries, the bundled VAD model,
 * downloadable speech models) needs an entry in both, in the same change.
 *
 * ## Copyright handling (why this is per-component, not per-license)
 *
 * MIT and BSD license texts embed the licensor's copyright line *as part of
 * the license* — MIT's required notice and BSD clause 1. So a single shared
 * "MIT" / "BSD" body would display the wrong copyright holder for every
 * component except the one it was written for. Therefore:
 *
 *  - **MIT / BSD components** each carry their own exact license text
 *    ([Component.textAsset]) with the correct holder — sourced verbatim from
 *    the component where it vendors one, else the canonical body + the
 *    authoritative copyright line.
 *  - **Apache-2.0 / MPL-2.0 / OFL-1.1** (and other standalone bodies such as
 *    GPL or CC) have no embedded licensor copyright (attribution lives in
 *    NOTICE files / source headers / the font's name table), so those share one
 *    body ([License.sharedAsset]) and the component's [Component.copyright]
 *    supplies the attribution. Such a component must NOT set
 *    [Component.textAsset] to the shared body: that marks the body as
 *    embedding the copyright, and the attribution would never be shown.
 *
 * Full texts for the [License.sharedAsset] / [Component.textAsset] entries
 * live in `app/src/main/assets/licenses/`. Components with neither a shared
 * body nor a per-component text fall back to the upstream [License.url]
 * (none do today; `LicenseCatalogTest` requires every text to be bundled).
